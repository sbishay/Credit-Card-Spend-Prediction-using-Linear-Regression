# Overview
Analyzing Credit Card Spend of 5000 customer data

# Aim of Project
1. The objective of this case study is to understand what's driving the total spend of credit card(Primary Card + Secondary card).
2. Priotize the drivers based on the importance.

# Life Cycle of Project

1.Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis through understanding of data. 
Looking at the distribution of dependent variable and also segregating categorical with numerical variable. 
45% data having missing value

2.Feature Engineering

Deleting the variables is not ideal, hence Imputing missing value by mean value treatment
Outliers is capped with 5 and 95 percentile. 

3.Feature Selection

Significant categorical variables are selected through chi sq. test and stepwise regression. 
For numerical variable, log and sqrt transformation is applied to make normally distributed.

4.Model Building

Building the final model through splitting the dataset into development and validation datasets.
Predicting the total spend in both the datasets and creating top 10 decile to test modelâ€™s ability to predict the intended outcome.
